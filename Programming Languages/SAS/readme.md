# SAS (Statistical Analysis System)
SAS stands for Statistical Analysis System and it is written in C language. SAS is used in most of the operating systems. SAS can be used as a programming language and also as graphical interface. It was developed by Anthony James Barr and can read data from spreadsheets and databases. The output can be given as tables, graphs and documents. SAS is used to report, retrieve and analyze statistical data and it is also used to run SQL queries.

The SAS makes it very easy for an organization to work with the roughly gathered data and transform those into some useful outcomes that help the business in several ways. Here we will see how statistical analysis is used in various industries:
