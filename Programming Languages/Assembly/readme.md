# Assembly
Assembly language is a low-level programming language that is one step above machine code. It provides a symbolic representation of the numeric machine instructions, making it easier for humans to read and write. Here are some key aspects of assembly language:

Low-Level Language: Assembly language is considered low-level because it is closely related to the hardware's machine code instructions.

Hardware Specific: Each type of processor has its own assembly language, meaning code written for one type of CPU won't run on another without modification.

Mnemonic Codes: Instructions are written using mnemonic codes, which are abbreviations of the operation (e.g., MOV for move, ADD for addition).

Registers and Memory: Programmers have direct control over the CPU's registers and memory addresses.
Efficiency: Code written in assembly language can be highly optimized for performance and efficiency.
