# Competitive Programming (CP) 

Competitive programming is a type of mental sport where participants solve coding problems within a specified time limit.

These problems can range from simple tasks to complex algorithms and data structures challenges. 

Competitors often participate in online contests or in-person events, aiming to write the most efficient and correct code to solve the given problems. It helps improve problem-solving skills and coding proficiency.

Theoretical knowledge of algorithms is important to competitive programmers.Typically, a solution to a problem is a combination of well-known techniques and new insights. The techniques that appear in competitive programming also form the basis for the scientific research of algorithms.
