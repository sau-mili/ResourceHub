# Artificial Intelligence
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the field focused on creating systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation. This curated collection offers valuable AI resources contributed by talented individuals.

The main focus of artificial intelligence is towards understanding human behavior and performance. This can be done by creating computers with human-like intelligence and capabilities. This includes natural language processing, facial analysis and robotics. 
The main applications of AI are in military, healthcare, and computing; however, it’s expected that these applications will start soon and become part of our everyday lives.

This section is a curated collection of Artificial Intelligence beginner to advance resources.
